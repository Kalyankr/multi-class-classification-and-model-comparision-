# multi-class-classification-and-model-comparision-


When working on a supervised machine learning problem with a given data set, we try different algorithms and techniques to search for models to produce general hypotheses, which then make the most accurate predictions possible about future instances. The same principles apply to text (or document) classification where there are many models can be used to train a text classifier. The answer to the question “What machine learning model should I use?” is always “It depends.” Even the most experienced data scientists can’t tell which algorithm will perform best before experimenting them.

This is what we are going to do today: use everything that we have presented about text classification in the previous articles (and more) and comparing between the text classification models we trained in order to choose the most accurate one for our problem.

# Data

We are using a relatively large data set of Stack Overflow questions and tags. The data is available in Google BigQuery, it is also publicly available at this Cloud Storage URL: https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-workshop-examples/stack-overflow-data.csv.


So we cannot say which model is better for this pacticular dataset. But can go with better accuracy one.
